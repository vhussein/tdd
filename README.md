## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Testing methodology or a programming practice implemented from a developerâ€™s perspective
* The TDD methodology involves the following steps:
  * Based on the requirements specified in the documents, a developer writes an automated test case
  * These tests are executed, and in some cases, they fail as they are developed before the development of an actual feature
  * The development team then re-factors the code for the test to pass successfully

## Behavioral Driven Development (BDD)
* Testing approach derived from the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
* Tests are mainly based on systems behavior; Given-When-Then approach is used for writing test cases	
* Example:
  * Given the user has entered valid login credentials
  * When a user clicks on the login button
  * Then display the successful validation message
